<h1>The Best Movies According to Krischal Baniya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Truman Show </h3>
<p></p>I've seen The Truman Show a multitude of times, and each time it gets better.
First watching it at a young age (Roughly 10 years old), I never picked up on much of the deeper meaning behind the film.
The idea of someone's whole life being a television program was simply entertaining.
Now, as an older viewer and with more experience in analyzing books and movies, I can really pick up on the satirical meaning behind the plot.
Truman plays the star of a 24/7 television program. His entire life is broadcasted for all the world to see. He is raised to believe that there is no real reason to try and leave his perfect "island". 
Throughout the film, we watch as Truman tries time and time again to discover the truth behind his life, and as he attempts to escape. The struggle he experiences while trying to break free from the artificial world can be seen as a satirical message.
The world is trying to oppress you, and although difficult, you can escape. This is supported by a statement made by the creator of the Truman show. 
He said, "We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.It's as simple as that". Several other hidden messages (Ideas) appear throughout the film. All the actors who play roles in Truman's life, are indeed fake. Despite directly lying to a person whose life is immediately affected by that lie, the actors/actresses show no emotion for Truman.
This is comparable to the lack of care society has for the majority of its citizens.Overall, The Truman Show is filled with subliminal messages and hidden meanings, all of which can be directly tied back to daily life.</p>
<h3>The Dictator</h3>
<p>"The Dictator" is funny, in addition to being obscene, disgusting, scatological, vulgar, crude and so on.
Having seen Sacha Baron Cohen promoting it on countless talk shows, I feared the movie would feel like deja vu.
But no. He establishes a claim to be the best comic filmmaker now working. 
And in a speech about dictatorships, he practices merciless political satire.
Compared to the gleeful transgressions of "Borat" and "Bruno," this is Cohen's most conventional film. 
It has a plot, it has a romance, it sticks to the story. Not that it's mainstream, although judging by the laughter of a preview audience, who knows where the stream is anymore? He also wisely gets in, gets his laughs, and quits.
The movie, like Bruno," falls short of 90 minutes, in an era where too many comedies run on relentlessly.</p>
<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>Avatar is a 2009 epic science fiction film directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron.
The cast includes Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez and Sigourney Weaver. 
It is the first installment in the Avatar film series. It is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the valuable mineral unobtanium, the room-temperature superconductor mineral.
The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi, a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The title of the film refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.
Development of Avatar began in 1994, when James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for the film.Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron's 1997 film Titanic, for a planned release in 1999. However, according to Cameron, the necessary technology was not yet available to achieve his vision of the film.
Work on the language of the Na'vi began in 2005, and Cameron began developing the screenplay and fictional universe in early 2006. Avatar was officially budgeted at $237 million, due to the groundbreaking array of new visual effects Cameron achieved in cooperation with Weta Digital in Wellington.
Other estimates put the cost at between $280 million and $310 million for production and at $150 million for promotion.[17][18][19] The film made extensive use of new motion capture filming techniques and was released for traditional viewing, 3D viewing (using the RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats), and "4D" experiences in selected South Korean theaters.</p>
