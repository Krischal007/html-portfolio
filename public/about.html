<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>"Hello! I'm Krischl Baniya, a computing student from Nepal.From my very young age i was too much curious and passionate about technology and its creativity and this reason made me to do something in field of Technology"</p>
<p>
  Regarding my academic journey,
   I accomplished my School Leaving Certificate in the year 2015 from Siddhartha Shishu Sadan Secondary Boarding School, Biratnagar, Nepal with a 63.63% overall score.
   I was good in Mathematics and Science so I pursued my higher secondary education (+2) with a focus on the science faculty at Shikshadeep College, Biratnagar, Nepal with 64.84%.
   I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computing a three-year degree at Itahari International College, Itahari affiliated with London Metropolitan University, London, UK in December 2021.
   The British degree offered a more comprehensive curriculum that included hands-on labs, research-based instruction, and documentation that was properly cited. I had to work hard to finish the tasks that were given, using only reliable sources and avoiding plagiarism.
   It was helpful to me in finishing my Course project, "Plagiarism Checker," which checked that the work was properly cited and that the supplied material was original.
   Moreover, the weekly coursework and assignments provided by the college taught me to do research and helped to build the foundation for both practical and theoretical learning</p>

  After completing my degree, I got an opportunity as a Project Assistant at Aarti Strips Pvt. Ltd in Biratnagar, Nepal, with a tenure from 5th February 2022 to till now.
  My daily tasks include taking feedback on the field teamâ€™s progress and also making regular plans to work with Teams. I immersed myself in working under the assistantship of a qualified project manager.
  Writing several reports, attending meetings, analyzing data, managing resources, creating schedules, updating files and documentation, and tracking progress toward milestones were several tasks that I learned Working in the organization.
  I was able to work on different IOT(Internet Of Things) projects which included a Baby Monitoring system,  smart Dustbin, Weather Reporting system, and home automation system.
  All of these projects were in a group so managing the whole strategy from base was quite challenging. While working on these projects due to effective project management practices and organizational skills I was able to handle it fluently.
  Familiarity with project management tools and office software also helped me to make the tasks more efficient and help them adapt to overcome challenges as they arise throughout the project. Furthermore, Every aspect of my knowledge played a crucial role in ensuring the efficient methodology of project management.  Additionally,  I was able to gain knowledge of various project management software such as; HiTask which helped me to set up projects, share calendars, and create tasks among them. While uploading documents, Initiating tasks, and messaging team members ClickUp program played a vital role. Gathering several ideas inside the mind and converting them into actionable tasks Flowlu was best at all. TeamGantt was also used to let team members plan and schedule large or small projects, invite stakeholders and clients to collaborate, and set up task dependencies. Trello allowed all the team members and project managers to plan projects by using digital cards and allowed them to add due dates, comments, and files. Furthermore, Airtable was effective in tracking the range of elements which includes tables, contents, and events. Moreover, Todolist is a user-friendly productivity platform that helps to manage individuals' projects to make them stay on task throughout the day.
  Throughout my experience, I have keenly observed the better pay, higher decision-making authority, and bigger impact of managers in any organization.
  I believe I am well experienced to serve in such key leadership positions but the only limiting factor is my academic credentials. Hence, to reinforce my resume to work as a project manager I need to have a specialized knowledge of Project Management
